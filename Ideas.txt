Use GroupID to control the amount of a group
Improve obstacle avoidance algorithm 
(currently, if many obstacles are close to each other, boid tends to fail to avoid 
=> check to make sure there are no obstacle ahead after change direction)
Have sliders to control ForceFactors
Add ability to save obstacle map
Optimize using Spatial Hashing
